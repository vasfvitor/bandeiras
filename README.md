## Made with Astro + Tailwind

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

Get to know each flag and coat of arms from Brazil. This project contains pictures of all flags and coat of arms, along with descriptions (written in Portuguese). To further expand, there's a quiz to challenge your knowledge.

Each of 27 pages for each state are dynamically generated by Astro using `/src/pages/uf/[UF].astro` template. Data is sourced from `src/pages/uf/estados.json`. Flags and coat of arms are in a lightbox where one can zoom and see the details. 

The quiz is written entirely in typescript. Features includes random sorting of flags, score based on number of tries vs correct answers, visual indication of whether the question was answered in first try (green), before the tip (yellow) and with the tip (red). The tip is actually the answer, and it shows up in the 5th wrong try. It works both on mobile and desktop, note that on mobile the page will auto scroll to the answer position.

The Brazil map `BR.svg` came [from this project](https://github.com/ahuseyn/interactive-svg-maps). The map code logic is based in the same mentioned project script, but it was redone in typescript and heavily modified to match my ideas.
